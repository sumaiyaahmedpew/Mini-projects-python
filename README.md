#  Student Performance Dashboard (Python Console App)

This is a **menu-driven Python console application** that manages student performance data.  
It demonstrates core Python concepts (functions, recursion, decorators, arrays/NumPy, functional programming) in a **real-world use case**.  


##  Features

âœ… **Add Student** â€“ Input student name, roll, and marks (NumPy array).  
âœ… **View Student Report** â€“ Show marks, average, highest, lowest, pass/fail, grade (with decorator logging).  
âœ… **Class Statistics** â€“ Average per subject, highest & lowest, count of pass/fail students.  
âœ… **Utilities Section** â€“  
   - Fibonacci sequence generator (recursion).  
   - Factorial calculator using recursion & reduce (with performance comparison).  
âœ… **Exit** â€“ Close the application.  


##  Concepts Covered
- Variables, Data Types, Operators  
- Loops, Functions & Arguments  
- Recursion (Fibonacci, Factorial)  
- Decorators (Logging student grade calculation)  
- NumPy Arrays (Statistics & Aggregation)  
- Functional Programming (Map/Reduce)  
- Menu-Driven App Design
